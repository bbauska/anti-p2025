          <h2 class="chapter-title">Albert Einstein (ælbət aɪnstaɪn)</h2>
          <p>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. 
            Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling 
            at the Luitpold Gymnasium (secondary school). Later, they moved to Italy and Albert 
            continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal 
            Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics.</p>
          <p>In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was 
            unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the 
            Swiss Patent Office.</p>
          <p>In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree. Einstein’s researches are, of course, well 
            chronicled and his more important works include Special Theory of Relativity (1905), 
            Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity (1916), 
            Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics 
            (1938). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My 
            Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.</p>
          <p>In a recently unearthed recording of an interview conducted over 30 years ago, a former 
            assistant to Albert Einstein alleges that the famed scientist was enlisted to examine 
            the Roswell wreckage, including the ET occupants of the downed craft. UFO researcher 
            Anthony Bragalia uncovered the remarkable revelation when he tracked down ufologist 
            Sheila Franklin, who interviewed Dr. Shirley Wright in 1993 about her time working 
            with Einstein in the summer of 1947. As luck would have it, Franklin still had the 
            tapes from her conversation with the former assistant and what she told the researcher 
            was nothing short of stunning.</p>
          <p>According to Wright, she accompanied Einstein to what had been dubbed a <mark>"crisis 
            conference"</mark> that was hastily held in July of 1947 at a remote army airbase in the 
            American southwest. Upon their arrival, the duo entered a hangar that was under 
            heavy security and, when they entered the building, they discovered that it contained 
            a rather curious craft that appeared to have sustained significant damage.</p>
          <p>"It was disc-shaped, sort of concave," Wright recalled, "its size stood up to 
            one-fourth of the hangar floor."</p>
          <p>While her response to the strange scene was one of "wonderment, half curiosity 
            and maybe half fear," she said that Einstein was "not disturbed at all" and, 
            instead, was primarily concerned with what sort of insights about propulsion 
            and the universe could be gleaned from the vehicle.</p>
          <p>The year of this Einstein quote (1952) is more than interesting. It is the 
            same year that the Robertson Panel (on which Einstein’s associate Goudsmit 
            served) was planned. It was also the same year that mass UFO sightings 
            were occurring with frequency over Washington, DC. And it was the same 
            year that Frank Edwards maintained Einstein had warned the President about 
            attacking the saucers.</p>
          <p>What is more interesting about the Einstein quote is what is not said. Though 
            Einstein admits that there is reality to the phenomena ("These people are seeing 
            something"), he says that he does not want to know just what it is that the people 
            are seeing. This is of course disingenuous of Einstein. Since when does science 
            shy away from encouraging finding solutions to mysteries?</p>
          <p>Einstein’s own friend and associate Goudsmit certainly was interested in the 
            phenomena during the same time period Einstein was writing Gardner about it!</p>
          <p>It sounds more like Einstein simply does not wish to engage someone outside 
            of his circle on this obviously sensitive matter.</p>
          <p>Another interpretation is that Einstein really did not want to know because 
            he was afraid to know. And this makes sense. If what Edwards says is true, 
            Einstein feared the phenomenon.</p>
          <p>But what he feared more was us. Einstein feared our potential for a war-like 
            reaction to the continued flyovers of craft that were piloted by beings that 
            were not from here and that were unknown to science.</p>

              a mysterious object seen in the sky for which it is claimed no orthodox 
              scientific explanation can be found, often supposed to be a vehicle carrying 
              extraterrestrials.

            <li>Header area with the title of the book on the left, and the author of 
              said book on the right. <em>Erin is aware that content within the header 
              of the same page as a chapter title does not appear, but she made an 
              exception</em>.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>She was then picturing herself making marks on a novel like she used to 
            in school. In her true fashion, she got carried away with "What ifs."</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"What if highlighting the text actually looked <mark>like a highlighter</mark>?"
              <ul>
                <li>"What if I wanted it to be <mark class="pink">pink</mark>?"</li>
                <li>"<mark class="blue">Blue</mark>?"</li>
                <li>"<mark class="green">Green</mark>?"</li>
                <li>"<mark class="orange">Orange</mark>?"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <!-- cross out 'a typo', replace with 'an error in the content' -->
            <li>"What if I found <s>a typo</s><sup>an error in the content</sup> and 
              wanted to make a correction?"</li>
            <li>"What if I was viewing this on mobile&mdash;"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The true obstacle showed its form. Responsiveness. How on Earth will she 
            make this work?</p>
          <p>Erin pulled out her notepad and started sketching. First she began to 
            illustrate the wireframe of the book in its entirety. Then she recorded 
            some notes on how each element would break down as the screen size got 
            smaller. After several minutes, the blueprint was complete. She came to 
            the conclusion that mobile viewing must stay minimal. The pages go away, 
            which makes the page numbers no longer have a function so they must go 
            away, and if those go away then there is no need for a cover since it is 
            used to help hold and protect pages.</p>
          <p>She looks back at the blinking cursor of her blank canvas in Sublime Text 
            2. Doubt begins to linger in the back of her mind with the thought of her 
            new code never being used and her time spent ends up being a waste. Her 
            fingers were typing anyway.</p>
          <p>Erin smirked, "Well at least I think it's worth a try."</p>
          <p>The goal is to minimalize your web site so it first (and foremost) looks 
            beautiful on an android or apple phone. Then, make it look the best on a 
            desktop. 3rd, tablet or small laptop.</p>
