          <h2 class="chapter-title">Assholes,<br>
          Money &amp;<br>
          Project 2025</h2>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Project 2025 is a product of the Heritage Foundation, 
            one of Washington's most prominent right-wing think tanks. It first produced 
            policy plans for future Republican administrations in 1981, when Ronald Reagan 
            was about to take office. It has produced similar documents in connection with 
            subsequent presidential elections, including in 2016, when Trump first won the 
            presidency. That's not unusual - it's common for US think tanks of all political 
            stripes to propose policy wish lists for future governments.</p>
          <p>There's no denying Heritage has been influential during Republican presidencies. 
            One year into Trump's first term, the think tank boasted that the White House had 
            adopted nearly two-thirds of its proposals. Its latest set of recommendations was 
            unveiled in April 2023, but went largely unnoticed outside of policy circles 
            until the heat of the presidential campaign, when Democratic opposition to the 
            document ramped up.</p>
          <p>Democratic politicians launched a "Stop Project 2025 Task Force" and even set up 
            a tip line to collect insider information on Heritage's activities. The Harris 
            campaign and its surrogates consistently brought up the project in interviews 
            and speeches.</p>
          <p>Trump began actively pushing away from the document in July 2024. "I know 
            nothing about Project 2025," he posted on his social media platform, Truth 
            Social. "I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the 
            things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal." The team that 
            created the project was chock-full of former Trump advisers, including 
            director Paul Dans, who was chief of staff at the Office of Personnel 
            Management while Trump was president. Dans later left the project.</p>
          <p>But other Project 2025 authors have been welcomed into government jobs. Russell 
            Vought, a self-described Christian nationalist, wrote a key chapter in the 
            document and was confirmed by the Senate to lead the Office of Budget 
            Management, which administers the $6.75tn (£5.44tn) federal budget. Vought - 
            who Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer called "the chief architect of Project 
            2025, its intellectual inspiration" - was also put in charge of the Consumer 
            Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that the Trump administration has 
            indicated it would like to close.</p>
          <p>Other Project 2025 authors nominated to government positions include CIA 
            director John Ratcliffe; Brendan Carr, chosen to oversee the Federal 
            Communications Commission; Tom Homan, Trump's "border czar"; Paul Atkins, 
            nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission; and trade advisor 
            Peter Navarro. More than 100 conservative organisations contributed to the 
            document, Heritage says, including many that will now be hugely influential 
            in Washington. The document itself sets out four main policy aims: restore 
            the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative 
            state; defend the nation's sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given 
            individual rights to live freely. Some of the proposals have already formed 
            the basis for Trump's executive orders - although in a number of cases they 
            are also mentioned in other policy documents, including the Republican 
            platform and Trump's Agenda47 campaign manifesto..</p>

          Foundation<br>
          and<br>
		  King Trump</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, 
            including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under 
            direct presidential control - a controversial idea known as "unitary executive 
            theory". In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president 
            to directly implement policies in a number of areas.</p>
          <p>The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of 
            government employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.
            The document labels the FBI a "bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless 
            organization". It calls for drastic overhauls of the agency and several 
            others, as well as the complete elimination of the Department of Education.</p>
          <p>Shortly after being sworn in, Trump moved to eliminate job protections for 
            career civil servants, and freeze federal spending. Through Elon Musk and the 
            Department of Government Efficiency, the White House has moved to chop billions 
            in federal spending, although the details and legal status of the cuts are hazy 
            at best. DOGE is not an official government department, but rather an outside 
            team advising Trump with broad authority from the president.</p>
          <p>It's clear however that Trump intends to take a sledgehammer to the federal 
            government as it stood (Jan 15, 2025) ands - a goal directly in line with Project 
            2025 suggestions.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title"><br>Abortion<br><br>
        and Family</h2>
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The mentions of abortion in Project 2025 - there are 
            about 200 of them - have sparked some of the most contentious debate. The 
            document does not call for an outright nationwide abortion ban, and Trump 
            says he would not sign such a law. However, it proposes withdrawing the 
            abortion pill mifepristone from the market, and using existing but little-
            enforced laws to stop the drug being sent through the post.</p>
          <p>The document proposes new data collection efforts on abortion and more 
            generally suggests that the department of Health and Human Services should 
            "maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage 
            and family".</p>
          <p>Trump, by contrast, has generally said that abortion laws should mostly be 
            left to individual states. However, during confirmation hearings, Trump's 
            nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said the president had 
            ordered him to examine the safety record of mifepristone and left open the 
            possibility of further regulation of the drug. Trump also issued an executive 
            order designed to stop federal funds being used for abortion, a move that was 
            outlined in detail in the Project 2025 document.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Immigration</h2>
        <article>
         <p class="tallFirstLetter">Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border 
           - one of Trump's signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document. But 
           Trump's signature immigration policy - a pledge to deport millions of undocumented 
           immigrants - is not spelled out in any detail in Project 2025. The document does 
           include language calling on Trump to "thoroughly enforce immigration laws". But 
           in the main chapter dealing with immigration, Project 2025 authors suggest 
           dismantling the Department of Homeland Security and combining it with other 
           immigration enforcement units in other agencies, creating a much larger and more 
           powerful border policing operation.</p>
         <p>Other proposals include eliminating visa categories for crime and human trafficking 
           victims, increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for 
           migrants who pay a premium. But it was mass deportations - not a bureaucratic 
           shuffle, visa changes or a longer, taller border wall - that was Trump's top pitch 
           to voters. On this issue, his administration promises to go in a slightly different 
           direction - and potentially much further - than the Project 2025 proposals.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Energy,<br>
        climate<br>
        and<br>
		trade</h2>
        <article>
         <p class="tallFirstLetter">Energy policy is a broad area of agreement between 
           Trump and the Project 2025 proposals, summed up by one of the president's 
           campaign slogans: "Drill, baby, drill". The new administration wants to ramp 
           up fossil fuel production and has taken the US out of the Paris Agreement on 
           climate change, which seeks to limit emissions and global warming.</p>
         <p>Project 2025 proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in 
           renewable energy, and calls for the next president to "stop the war on oil and 
           natural gas" - ideas that the Trump campaign has enthusiastically taken up. The 
           document sets out two competing visions on tariffs: one suggesting boosting free 
           trade and another pro-tariff position.</p>
         <p>Trump has clearly sided with the latter camp, announcing import taxes targeting 
           Canada, Mexico and China. The economic advisers of Project 2025 suggest that a 
           second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the 
           Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. While the 
           president has made comments about proposals in some of these areas, the economic 
           talk in the early days of his administration has been dominated by tariffs.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title"><br>Tech<br><br>
        and DEI</h2>
        <!-- Article 7 -->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Almost immediately upon taking office, Trump moved to 
            end diversity, equity and inclusion programs and decreed that government 
            departments would recognise only two genders. Those moves are broadly in line 
            with Project 2025, which took aim at DEI and gender terminology as part of what 
            it describes as a wider crackdown on "woke" ideology.</p>
          <p>The document also calls for greater school choice - essentially subidising 
            religious and private schools with public funds - which was also the subject 
            of an early Trump executive order. And it calls for abolishing the Department 
            of Education, another idea that Trump has signalled he supports.</p>
          <p>In other proposals, Project 2025 suggests banning pornography and shutting 
            down tech and telecoms companies that allow access to adult material. This has so 
            far not been a focus of the new administration, which has drawn support from a 
            number of top tech bosses. Trump's views on the tech industry have regularly 
            shifted, and don't appear to have much to do with sexual content.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">The plan's<br>
		uncertain<br>
        (yet probable)<br>
		future</h2>
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The writing of Project 2025 was a massive undertaking, 
            backed by a $22m (£17m) budget from Heritage. Not to mention an additional 333 
            million spent by the White South Afrikaner, Musk. It includes strategies for 
            implementing policies, such as the creation of a database of conservative 
            loyalists to fill government positions, and a programme to train those new 
            workers.</p>
          <p>There are clear areas of agreement and overlapping personnel. However, many of 
            the themes of Project 2025 were independently being touted by the Trump campaign. 
            It's still early in Trump's second term, and we are unclear how far the president 
            will be able to go in reshaping the vast US federal government. Democrats have 
            indicated they will continue to oppose the proposals and highlight Project 
            2025's influence.</p>
          <p>And many of the president's executive orders and other actions will continue 
            to face political and legal challenges. The 900-page blueprint for a second 
            Trump presidency would gut federal education funding, sanction discrimination 
            against LGBTQ+ students, divert taxpayer funds to private schools, and codify 
            book bans and classroom censorship on a national level. That's just the 
            beginning.</p>

        Educator Voices</h2>
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Labeling the National Education Association (NEA) a 
            “radical special interest group,” Project 2025 calls on Congress to revoke 
            NEA’s congressional charter and threatens educators’ ability to come together 
            and work in union to advocate for their students and their profession.</p>
          <p>NEA is a powerful voice for public schools across the country, mobilizing its 
            members for increased education funding, higher pay for educators, and against 
            school privatization schemes.  Project 2025 sees the collective voice of educators 
            as a major obstacle to implementing their extremist agenda at the state and local 
            level, which is why it seeks to bulldoze their collective bargaining power – 
            indeed, dismantle all workers’ right to organize via unions–and the ability to 
            advocate for themselves and their students.</p>
